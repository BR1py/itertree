Human protection
****************

In older versions we added the human protect patch to the MIT licence.
The patch was removed from the licence from version 1.1.4 on.

This is just made for compatibility reasons related to other software projects using this package.
For the authors the human protect patch would still make sense. But we believe that a wider usage
of the package brings more positive effects then negative effects (related to human protection too).

To express our intention we finally ask every user to consider the following extension
on an **optional voluntarily** base (even that the additional article is no more part of the license):

*Human protection*:
The program and its derivative work will neither be modified or executed to harm any human being nor through
inaction permit any human being to be harmed.

At least in our opinion people should take more responsibility for the objectives they are delivering and publishing.
The global society should find new and better regulations for such proposes. Currently we see on the one hand side
nearly total freedom to use any artifact for the users advantage (like MIT) and on the other hand we have relative
high protected areas (copyrights, patents) which limits the usage mainly to protect the owners advantages related
to his benefit (win money, win force, etc.). We need here additional possibilities, like free patents
and a more detailed control related to the usage of these objectives
(like human protection or non exclusive rights only). Related to open source licences a cascade setup
of licence regulations might be possible.
